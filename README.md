# Tooth-Cavity-Detection
- converting the dataset images into different sizes.
- proposing and implementing a CNN model that uses 2-D convolutions.
- training the cnn model alongside other pre-trained models namely ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetv2, InceptionV3.
- comparing the results using evaluation metrics accuracy and loss.
- repeating the process for datasets of different sizes(ex: 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024).
